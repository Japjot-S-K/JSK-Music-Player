# JSK-Music-Player
A sleek and responsive web-based music player built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project mimics a minimal Spotify-like experience, allowing users to browse music folders, play songs, seek through tracks, adjust volume, toggle themes, and more â€” all from the browser.
